-Solve Leaf tests : done! (found D,E,a,c for Schur)

-InnerProducts : computes inner products solely on the blocks corresponding to the states and controls at current and next time steps
 - We calculate B_tag and b_tag
 how to check this if not within np.dot/dgemm?

-FctorizeBbar (we just have linalg.cho_factor), just computes cholesky fact of B tag and b_tag(this is in soln loop)

-SolveBbar (just have cho_solve), solve cholesky fot y

-UpdateSchur (maybe need to check updateShur?), solve x and z
