-Solve Leaf tests : done! (found D,E,a,c for Schur)

-InnerProducts : computes inner products solely on the blocks corresponding to the states and controls at current and next time steps
 - We calculate B_tag and b_tag
 how to check this if not within np.dot/dgemm?

-FctorizeBbar (we just have linalg.cho_factor), just computes cholesky fact of B tag and b_tag(this is in soln loop)

-SolveBbar (just have cho_solve), solve cholesky fot y

-UpdateSchur (maybe need to check updateShur?), solve x and z

OCT 10:::
-- check matrix structure for small example (N=2/N=4/N=1?)
--call np.linalg on traditional KKT, on BCHOl and on BCHOL matrix

//Adding BCHOL inside solveKKTSystem - adding 0 to g


Oct 14::
--building the matrix for example and getting the same answer

Oct 16::
-- NP.Linalg == BCHOL! 

now you have a ground truth building form Q,R and etc

Next things to do: integrate your Bchol into pendulum
check your soln for other timesteps (4,8,16,32...)
comeback to Cuda and clean/optimize code

First things first :
- add it to pendulum

Oct 21:
Added BCHOl and LQRbuild to TrajopMPCReference - throws an error on level 1  (is_choleskysafe)

 - fix buildBCHOL from blocks or delete it
 - test BCHOL for different examples
